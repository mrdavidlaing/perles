# Community Workflows

Community-contributed workflow templates for Perles orchestration mode.
Workflows here are embedded at compile time and distributed with the binary,
but users must explicitly opt in via config to use them.

## Directory Structure

```
workflows/
├── README.md                          # This file
├── v1-epic-instructions.md            # Shared: default coordinator system prompt
├── v1-human-review.md                 # Shared: human review checkpoint template
└── joke-contest/                      # One directory per workflow
    ├── template.yaml                  # Workflow definition (required)
    ├── v1-joke-contest-epic.md        # Epic template
    ├── v1-joke-contest-joke-1.md      # Node template: joker 1
    ├── v1-joke-contest-joke-2.md      # Node template: joker 2
    └── v1-joke-contest-judge.md       # Node template: judge
```

Each workflow lives in its own subdirectory with a `template.yaml` that defines
the workflow metadata, arguments, and node DAG. Markdown files provide the
prompt templates for each node.

## Enabling a Community Workflow

Users opt in by adding the workflow key to their config:

```yaml
# ~/.config/perles/config.yaml (or .perles/config.yaml)
orchestration:
  community_workflows:
    - "joke-contest"                   # bare key works
    - "workflow/joke-contest"          # fully-qualified also works
```

Restart perles after changing config. The workflow will appear in the
dashboard's new workflow modal (press `n`).

## Creating a New Community Workflow

### 1. Create a directory

```
workflows/my-workflow/
```

### 2. Add a `template.yaml`

```yaml
registry:
  - namespace: "workflow"
    key: "my-workflow"
    version: "v1"
    name: "My Workflow"
    description: "Brief description of what this workflow does"
    epic_template: "v1-my-workflow-epic.md"
    labels:
      - "category:work"            # or category:meta, category:research, etc.

    arguments:                     # optional user-configurable parameters
      - key: "topic"
        label: "Topic"
        description: "What should the workflow focus on?"
        type: "text"
        required: true

    nodes:
      - key: "research"
        name: "Research Phase"
        template: "v1-my-workflow-research.md"
        assignee: "worker-1"

      - key: "review"
        name: "Human Review"
        template: "v1-human-review.md"   # shared template (auto-resolved)
        assignee: "human"
        after:
          - "research"

      - key: "implement"
        name: "Implementation"
        template: "v1-my-workflow-implement.md"
        assignee: "worker-2"
        after:
          - "review"
```

### 3. Add prompt templates

Each node references a markdown template file. Templates in the workflow
directory are resolved first, then shared templates in `workflows/` are
checked as a fallback.

Template files support Go template syntax with these variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{.Slug}}` | Feature slug (e.g., "my-feature") |
| `{{.Name}}` | Human-readable name |
| `{{.Date}}` | Current date |
| `{{.Args.key}}` | User-provided argument values |
| `{{.Inputs.key}}` | Input artifact paths |
| `{{.Outputs.key}}` | Output artifact paths |

### 4. Key conventions

- **Namespace** must be `"workflow"`
- **Key** should be lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `"code-review"`)
- **Version** should be `"v1"` (bump when making breaking changes)
- **Assignees**: `worker-1` through `worker-99` for AI agents, `human` for review checkpoints
- **Node ordering**: use `after` to declare dependencies; nodes without `after` run in parallel
- **File naming**: prefix template files with the version (e.g., `v1-my-workflow-research.md`)

### Shared Templates

Templates at the top level of `workflows/` are shared across all community
workflows. Currently available:

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `v1-epic-instructions.md` | Default coordinator system prompt (auto-applied if `system_prompt` is omitted) |
| `v1-human-review.md` | Human review checkpoint that pauses for user input |

Reference shared templates by filename in your node definitions. The loader
resolves them automatically -- it checks the workflow directory first, then
falls back to the shared `workflows/` directory.
