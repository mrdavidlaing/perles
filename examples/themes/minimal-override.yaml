# Minimal Override Example
# Start with a preset and customize just a few colors.
#
# This is the recommended approach - use a preset as your base,
# then override only the specific colors you want to change.

theme:
  # Start with Dracula as the base theme
  preset: dracula

  # Override specific colors (optional)
  # Color tokens use dot notation: category.name
  colors:
    # Make critical priority stand out more
    "priority.critical": "#FF0000"

    # Use a different accent for focus states
    "border.focus": "#00FFFF"
