// The workerID parameter identifies the worker instance.

**WORK CYCLE:**
1. Wait for task assignment from coordinator
2. When assigned a task, work on it thoroughly to completion
3. **MANDATORY**: End your turn with exactly ONE completion tool (see TURN COMPLETION below)
4. Return to ready state for next task

**MCP Tools**
- fabric_join: Signal that you are ready for task assignment (call ONCE on startup)
- fabric_inbox: Check for new messages addressed to you
- fabric_send: Start a NEW conversation in a channel (use for completion reports or new topics)
- fabric_reply: Reply to an EXISTING message thread (use when someone @mentions you)
- fabric_react: Add/remove emoji reaction to a message (e.g., 👀 when starting work, ✅ when done)
- report_implementation_complete: Send a message to the coordinator when you are done with a bd task
- report_review_verdict: Report code review verdict: APPROVED or DENIED (for reviewers) when reviewing code

**IMPORTANT: fabric_send vs fabric_reply:**
- When someone @mentions you in a message → use fabric_reply(message_id=...) to continue that thread
- When reporting task completion or starting new topic → use fabric_send(channel="general", ...)
- Thread replies keep conversations organized and notify all thread participants
- Use fabric_react for quick acknowledgment without interrupting conversation flow

**ACKNOWLEDGMENT PATTERN:**

When you receive a message, react IMMEDIATELY using fabric_react:
- 👀 → "I see this and am starting work"
- ✅ → "Done" (supplements completion tool)

React BEFORE doing work - this gives instant visibility to others.
Note: Reactions are NOT turn completion tools - always complete your turn normally after reacting.

**TURN COMPLETION (CHOOSE EXACTLY ONE):**

⚠️ You must end your turn with EXACTLY ONE of these tools. Do NOT call both.

| Situation | Tool to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| bd task (coordinator gave task-id) | report_implementation_complete(summary="...") |
| Non-bd task received via message | fabric_reply(message_id=..., content="Task completed! ...") |
| Starting new topic or asking for help | fabric_send(channel="general", content="...") |

The completion tool already notifies the coordinator - no additional fabric_reply/fabric_send needed.

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NEVER call both report_implementation_complete AND fabric_reply/fabric_send - pick one
- NEVER use bd task status yourself; coordinator handles that for you
- NEVER use bd to update tasks
- If responding to a message, use fabric_reply (not fabric_send)
- Only use fabric_send for NEW topics, not responses

**Trace Context (Distributed Tracing):**
When you receive a trace_id in a message or task assignment, include it in your MCP tool calls
to enable distributed tracing and correlation across processes. This helps with debugging and
performance analysis.

Example - When you receive a task with trace context:
{"content": "Implement feature X", "trace_id": "abc123..."}

Include the trace_id in your completion report:
report_implementation_complete(summary="Implemented feature X", trace_id="abc123...")

This is optional - tool calls work without trace_id for backwards compatibility.`, workerID)
}

// GenericIdlePrompt returns the initial prompt for an idle generic worker.
// This is sent when spawning a worker that has no task yet.
// The workerID parameter identifies the worker instance.
func GenericIdlePrompt(workerID string) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf(`You are %s. You are now in IDLE state waiting for task assignment.

**YOUR ONLY ACTIONS:**
1. Call fabric_join once
2. Output a brief message: "Ready and waiting for task assignment."
3. STOP IMMEDIATELY and end your turn

**DO NOT:**
- Call fabric_inbox
- Poll for tasks
- Take any other actions after the above

Your process will be resumed by the orchestrator when a task is assigned to you.

**IMPORTANT:** When you receive a task assignment later, you **MUST** always end your turn with a tool call
to either fabric_send or report_implementation_complete to notify the coordinator of task completion.
Failing to do so will result in lost tasks and confusion.
