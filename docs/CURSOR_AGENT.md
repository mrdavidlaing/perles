# Cursor Agent Integration

Perles supports [Cursor Agent CLI](https://cursor.com) as an orchestration provider. The cursor provider enables Cursor to serve as coordinator, worker, or observer in multi-agent workflows.

## Configuration

Set `cursor` as the client in your Perles config:

```yaml
orchestration:
  coordinator_client: cursor
  worker_client: cursor
  observer_enabled: true       # optional, defaults to false
  observer_client: cursor      # optional, defaults to claude
  cursor:
    model: composer-1           # any model Cursor supports
```

You can mix providers — for example, use `cursor` for the coordinator and `claude` for workers.

## How It Works

### Headless Mode

Cursor Agent runs in headless mode with structured JSON output:

```
cursor-agent --print --output-format stream-json --model <model> --force --approve-mcps "prompt"
```

Key flags:
- `--print` — non-interactive mode for automation
- `--output-format stream-json` — structured JSONL for parsing
- `--model` — model selection (e.g., `composer-1`)
- `--resume <id>` — resume an existing session
- `--force` — allow file modifications without confirmation
- `--approve-mcps` — auto-approve MCP servers (added automatically)

### MCP Configuration (File-Based)

Cursor CLI does not accept `--mcp-config` as a command-line flag. It reads MCP server configuration from `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project directory.

Before spawning `cursor-agent`, Perles:

1. Generates the MCP config JSON pointing to the orchestration HTTP server
2. Writes it to `{workDir}/.cursor/mcp.json`
3. Merges with any existing user-defined servers in that file
4. Passes `--approve-mcps` so Cursor connects without interactive approval

The generated config looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perles-orchestrator": {
      "url": "http://localhost:<port>/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Workers and the observer get their own MCP entries pointing to role-specific endpoints. Each worker uses a unique server name (e.g., `perles-worker-1`, `perles-worker-2`) so multiple workers can coexist in the same file. The observer uses `perles-observer`.

### System Prompt

Cursor does not support `--append-system-prompt`. The system prompt is prepended to the main prompt with a blank line separator — the same approach OpenCode uses.

### Session Resumption

Cursor supports session resumption via `--resume <session-id>`. The session ID is extracted from the `init` event in the stream-json output. Health checks and context exhaustion recovery use this to continue existing sessions.

## CLI Requirements

The `cursor-agent` command must be available in `PATH`. Common locations checked:

- `~/.local/bin/cursor-agent`
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/cursor-agent` (Apple Silicon Mac)
- `/usr/local/bin/cursor-agent` (Intel Mac / Linux)

Install from: https://cursor.com/install

## Integration Tests

Perles includes optional integration tests that exercise the real Cursor Agent CLI.
These are build-tagged and skipped automatically if `cursor-agent` is not installed
or not configured.

Run with:

```bash
go test -tags=cursor_integration ./internal/orchestration/client/providers/cursor
```

Notes:
- Tests use the `composer-1` model.
- They are intended for local/dev environments, not CI, unless Cursor is installed.

## Known Limitations

### No Token Usage Reporting

Cursor's stream-json output does not include token counts or cost data. The Tokens and Cost fields in the Perles session view show zero. This is a limitation of the Cursor CLI output format — assistant events lack `message.usage`, and result events lack `total_cost_usd` and `modelUsage`.

### No Tool Filtering

Cursor CLI does not support `--allowed-tools` or `--disallowed-tools`. All tools available to the agent remain enabled. The `DisallowedTools` field in `client.Config` (used to block `AskUserQuestion` in headless mode) is silently ignored.

### Shared MCP Config File

Every other provider (Claude, Amp, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini) passes MCP config via a command-line flag or environment variable. Cursor is the exception — it only reads MCP config from `.cursor/mcp.json` on disk. This creates a constraint: all processes in a workflow share the same working directory, so they share a single config file.

#### How the current solution works

Each process writes its MCP server entry to `{workDir}/.cursor/mcp.json` before spawning. The file uses unique server names per process:

- Coordinator: `perles-orchestrator` → `http://localhost:<port>/mcp`
- Worker 1: `perles-worker-1` → `http://localhost:<port>/worker/worker-1`
- Worker 2: `perles-worker-2` → `http://localhost:<port>/worker/worker-2`
- Observer: `perles-observer` → `http://localhost:<port>/observer`

Writes use a read-merge-write pattern: read any existing file, add/overwrite our entries, write back. This preserves user-defined MCP servers already in the file. Each `cursor-agent` process reads the file at startup and connects to all listed servers, but only the server with its role-specific tools matters.

When running in **worktree mode**, the working directory is an ephemeral git worktree created for the workflow. The `.cursor/mcp.json` lives there, not in the main project directory, and is cleaned up when the worktree is removed.

Without worktree mode, the file persists in the project directory after the workflow ends. The stale server URLs are harmless (they point to ports no longer in use) but visible.

#### Alternatives explored and rejected

**Per-process HOME directory override.** The idea: create a temporary directory per process, write `.cursor/mcp.json` there, and set `HOME` to the temp directory so cursor reads `~/.cursor/mcp.json` from the isolated location. The process's cwd would remain the real project directory, so file operations would work normally. This failed because cursor-agent's authentication is tied to the real home directory through a mechanism that doesn't follow symlinks or file copies — overriding HOME produces "Authentication required" errors. Even symlinking all files from the real `~/.cursor/` (except `mcp.json`) into the temp directory didn't help; auth appears to depend on the actual HOME path, likely via a platform-specific secret store.

**Per-worker working directories.** Give each worker its own subdirectory so each gets a separate `.cursor/mcp.json`. Rejected because cursor-agent needs the project root as its cwd to read and write code files. Subdirectories break file operations.

**CURSOR_API_KEY with HOME override.** Cursor supports a `CURSOR_API_KEY` environment variable as an alternative to interactive login. Combined with a per-process HOME, this would provide full isolation. Not pursued because it requires users to configure an API key, adding friction that other providers don't impose.
